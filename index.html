                <div class="two-thirds column">
                    <p>Hi! My name is Rhys Diab, a lawyer turned full-stack web developer/software engineer with experience in Javascript (my personal favourite), React.JS, Redux, Node.JS, JQuery, Ruby On Rails, Bootstrap, Git/Github, HTML and CSS.. Like
                        many top performing students I was drawn to the most challenging course I could get into. Law seemed like the perfect choice for my results driven type-A personality. A profession with a wow factor. </p>

                    <p>Whilst law satisfied my craving to solve difficult problems, it didn’t take long to realise my passion lay elsewhere. All my fellow students were seeking clerkships and graduate positions at large law firms, but I was searching for
                        something different. Something in technology...</p>

                    <p>The company I worked for built software which automated the creation of legal documents for small businesses. It seemed like a match made in heaven. My job was to help create legal marketing content to attract more small-business owners
                        to the website. But as time went on I found myself spending increasingly more time with the development team. The technology, which was at the heart of the company completely fascinated me. Not long after that I made the jump into
                        an Immersive Web Development Bootcamp to pursue my true passion. Web development/Software Engineering. I haven't looked back since.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently working on a property app which values any property. At the moment it only works for properties in Sydney and the valuations are a little high. You can check it out here: https://propertyapp5690.herokuapp.com/ You can
                        also check out all my projects on github here: https://github.com/rhys5690</p>
